    "### The python class Attractor has multiple methods to perform a variety of operations. Some of which include the utilization of Euler and Runge-Kutta to increment through a set of given differential equations, plotting of the results from the given set of differential equations, test cases, and more. A few of the useful built-in tools at use here were numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "## --------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project required the following:\n",
    "###      - Attractor class\n",
    "###      - euler method\n",
    "###      - rk2 method\n",
    "###      -rk4 method\n",
    "###      - evolve method\n",
    "###      - save method\n",
    "###      - plotx, ploty, and plotz methods\n",
    "###      - plotxy, plotyz, and plotzx methods\n",
    "###      - plot3d method\n",
    "###      - test_attractor module\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Attractor class takes three initialization parameters and stores them as a numpy array. It also takes an additional three initialization parameters used to compute a time increment to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The euler method takes a numpy array and returns the Euler increment for the set of three given differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### rk2 proceeds very similarly to the euler method, however, returns the second order Runge-Kutta increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### rk4 is the same as rk2 with the exception of returning the fourth order Runge-Kutta increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The method evolve takes a numpy array and an integer order to generate a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A very straight forward method, save simply saves the self.solution variable to a CSV file on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### As to be expected from the names, plotx , ploty, and plotz take advantage of the matplotlib to generate two dimensional plots of the x(t), y(t), and z(t) curves vs. time accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The methods plotxy, plotyz, and plotzx plot the logical pairs of the solution curves in two dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking it a step further, the plot3d method generates a three dimensional plot of the x-y-z solution curves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our module test_attractor is where the tests are stored to experiment with the class and methods to ensure functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally, the ExploreAttractor notebook loads the entire module and uses it to answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "###     1. How does the plotted solution depend on your choice of time step size, and your choice of increment?  Do you see an improvement in precision from using the higher-order integration methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "###     2. How does the solution depend upon the initial conditions [x0, y0, z0]?  How small a change can you make while still reproducing roughly the same dynamical curves?"
